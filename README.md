# Multimodal Side-Tuning for Document Classification

In this repository we provide the implementation for the method proposed in the paper `citation`.

## Requirements

The proposed implementation is written in `Python3` using the `PyTorch` deep-learning framework and in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) there is a list of used packages along with their version.

However, some specification should be made:

1. the `FastText` package has been compiled [from the source repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) and not installed from the `PyPI` repository.
